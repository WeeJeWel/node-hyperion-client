# Hyperion for Homey
Control your [Hyperion](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion) server from Homey!

Hyperion is an opensource 'AmbiLight' implementation controlled using the Raspberry Pi.

This app allows you to control Hyperion from the Flow Editor:

* Set a solid color
* Set an effect (e.g. Knight Rider, or Mood Blobs)
* Turn the LEDs off
